# Javascript Statement

According to [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_statements.asp),

A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

## Types of statements

Variable Declaration Statement

``` var first = 'lenora'; ```

Function Call Statement

``` console.log('Hey, Lenora'); ```

Code Blocks are bound by curly brackets so they don't need the semicolon. Things like function definitions, if, and loops follow this pattern.

if (age > 10) {
  console.log('You are old');
}
